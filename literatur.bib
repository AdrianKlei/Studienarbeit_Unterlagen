 abstract = {The perception of speech of 167 children implanted with a CLARION

Multi-Strategy Cochlear Implant (1.2 device) was evaluated preimplantation

and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postimplantation. The children

were between 15 months and 15 years of age. The test materials consisted

of 8 tests involving syllable structure, single- and 2-syllable words,

differentiation of word pairs, and sentences. Two difficulty levels

were used, depending on developmental age ({\textless}7, and 7 to 15 years).

There was an improvement in test scores over time for both age groups.

The younger children (particularly those under age 4) improved steadily

over the first 2 years, while the older children tended to plateau

between 12 and 18 months after implantation. These findings demonstrate

that deaf children up to 15 years old benefit from cochlear implants.

Children under 4 years of age may even have the ability to compensate

for delays in speech development before they reach school age.},

 abstract = {Parking or docking behavior is a very important behavioral unit for mobile robots. In a typical mobile robot application, robots have to navigate to a pre-defined destination and perform a given task. In order to perform those types of tasks, robots usually need to be precisely aligned against a target pose. In a vision-based mobile robot docking system, the nonholonomic nature and limited field-of-view constraints are required to be incorporated in the control strategy. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid control solution to this problem using image-plane measurements. The final docking position of the robot is defined as an image-plane reference. The robot is controlled to match the current view of the docking station to the reference view. The experimental results are used lo demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed method provides a high level of robustness and precision which, is required in most practical applications},

 abstract = {Cochlear implants (CI) are electronic devices incorporating an electrode

inserted into the human cochlea for direct electric stimulation of

the auditory nerve. The implantation has become the standard treatment

for patients with severe-to-profound sensorineural loss not aidable

with conventional hearing aids. The state of the art operative technique

is a facial recess approach to the middle ear, following the opening

of the scala tympani (cochleostomy) and insertion of the electrode

array. The facial recess approach is applicable only by experienced

surgeons and optimal CI results primarily depend on optimal electrode

placement and minimal traumatic insertion. This also requires a certain

amount of experience. Additionally several groups work on minimally-invasive

approaches to the cochlea, resulting in the necessity to insert the

implant via a keyhole access, which is not applicable with current

techniques. This paper presents a mechatronic device for an automated

insertion of the electrode array of a cochlear implant system. Being

designed especially for minimally-invasive approaches, the tool is

also applicable for regular facial recess approaches. Moreover the

device allows reliable and repeatable insertion studies at synthetic

models or cadaver specimen. The functionality of the tool is proofed

with first experiments on a synthetic model.},

step for the preservation of residual hearing abilities, which allows

hybrid electro-acoustic stimulation (EAS). The authors propose a

the tool, implementing the AOS technique. For both studies, the achieved

insertion depth angle was evaluated by photographic or X-ray documentation.The

mean achieved insertion depth angle was 410 degrees for the lubricated

model and 330 degrees for the human cochlea specimen.The automated

insertion tool has proven its capability to perform electrode insertions

with final insertion depth angles within the target range of a standard

it represents the only possibility to automatically insert cochlear

First the object is on-line localized using a laser rangefinder taking into account sensor and robot pose uncertainties and then a PC-path is both planned and real-time controlled with a unique strategy.},

However, the empathic behavior of patients with damage to the vmPFC has not been measured experimentally in response to an empathy-eliciting event. This is important because characterizing the degree to which patients with damage to the vmPFC have lower empathic behavior will allow for the development of targeted interventions to improve patients' social skills and in turn will help family members to better understand their impairments so they can provide appropriate supports. For the first time, we induced empathy using an ecologically-valid empathy induction in neurological patients with damage to the vmPFC and measured their empathic emotional responses and behavior in real time. Eight neurological patients with focal damage to the vmPFC were compared to demographically-matched brain-damaged and healthy comparison participants. Patients with damage to the vmPFC gave less money in the empathy condition to a person who was suffering (a confederate) than comparison participants. This provides the first direct experimental evidence that the vmPFC is critical for empathic behavior toward individuals who are suffering.},

 abstract = {Detecting humans is a key skill for mobile robots and intelligent vehicles in a large variety of applications. While the problem is well studied for certain sensory modalities such as image data, few works exist that address this detection task using 2D range data. However, a widespread sensory setup for many mobile robots in service and domestic applications contains a horizontally mounted 2D laser scanner. Detecting people from 2D range data is challenging due to the speed and dynamics of human leg motion and the high levels of occlusion and self-occlusion particularly in crowds of people. While previous approaches mostly relied on handcrafted features, we recently developed the deep learning based wheelchair and walker detector DROW. In this paper, we show the generalization to people, including small modifications that significantly boost DROW's performance. Additionally, by providing a small, fully online temporal window in our network, we further boost our score. We extend the DROW dataset with person annotations, making this the largest dataset of person annotations in 2D range data, recorded during several days in a real-world environment with high diversity. Extensive experiments with three current baseline methods indicate it is a challenging dataset, on which our improved DROW detector beats the current state-of-the-art.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a geometrical feature detection framework for use with conventional 2D laser rangefinders. This framework is composed of three main procedures: data pre-processing, breakpoint detection and line extraction. In data pre-processing, low-level data organization and processing are discussed, with emphasis to sensor bias compensation. Breakpoint detection allows to determine sequences of measurements which are not interrupted by scanning surface changing. Two breakpoint detectors are investigated, one based on adaptive thresholding, and the other on Kalman filtering. Implementation and tuning of both detectors are also investigated. Line extraction is performed to each continuous scan sequence in a range image by applying line kernels. We have investigated two classic kernels, commonly used in mobile robots, and our Split-and-Merge Fuzzy (SMF) line extractor. SMF employs fuzzy clustering in a split-and-merge framework without the need to guess the number of clusters. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons using simulated and real images illustrate the main characteristics of the framework when using different methods for breakpoint and line detection. These comparisons illustrate the characteristics of each estimator, which can be exploited according to the platform computing power and the application accuracy requirements.},

From an operational perspective, however, their limited range and the long recharging times add considerable complexity to the decision tasks planning their efficient application. In this context, we treat a problem setting where a single electric vehicle executes transport requests along a straight line, which, for instance, occurs when cranes, automated guided vehicles, or shuttles handle boxes in container terminals. From time to time the vehicle needs to be recharged and, thus, has to visit some charging station also located on the line. We investigate the scheduling of a single electric vehicle, so that the makespan for executing all transport requests is minimized and the vehicle is timely recharged. The solution algorithm developed is then applied to also explore the location planning of charging stations.},

 abstract = {Large scale robotic teams are capable of working independently or cooperatively to carry out a variety of missions. However, for large teams of robots to function for extended periods of time, the individual members of a team must be able to generate or find energy to re-supply themselves. One approach to providing power for a robotic team is to couple larger systems with significant energy reserves so that the smaller systems can be recharged directly from the larger. This paper presents an implementation of such an approach. Here, a modular docking station is given locomotion through the cooperation of two larger robots. The docking station is capable of transporting, deploying, retrieving, and recharging many smaller robots. The kinematic model which will govern the cooperation of the maneuvering robots and will be used to develop control is presented and discussed. The design of the individual bays of the docking station and how they facilitate the deployment, recovery, and recharge of the smaller robots is also presented. The development of this system makes possible a number of applications, including autonomous long-term environmental monitoring and reconnaissance in various locations},

 abstract = {For robotic vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in pedestrian-rich environments, it is important to model subtle human behaviors and navigation rules (e.g., passing on the right). However, while instinctive to humans, socially compliant navigation is still difficult to quantify due to the stochasticity in people's behaviors. Existing works are mostly focused on using feature-matching techniques to describe and imitate human paths, but often do not generalize well since the feature values can vary from person to person, and even run to run. This work notes that while it is challenging to directly specify the details of what to do (precise mechanisms of human navigation), it is straightforward to specify what not to do (violations of social norms). Specifically, using deep reinforcement learning, this work develops a time-efficient navigation policy that respects common social norms. The proposed method is shown to enable fully autonomous navigation of a robotic vehicle moving at human walking speed in an environment with many pedestrians.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we show how a planning algorithm can be used to automatically create and update a Behavior Tree (BT), controlling a robot in a dynamic environment. The planning part of the algorithm is based on the idea of back chaining. Starting from a goal condition we iteratively select actions to achieve that goal, and if those actions have unmet preconditions, they are extended with actions to achieve them in the same way. The fact that BTs are inherently modular and reactive makes the proposed solution blend acting and planning in a way that enables the robot to efficiently react to external disturbances. If an external agent undoes an action the robot reexecutes it without re-planning, and if an external agent helps the robot, it skips the corresponding actions, again without replanning. We illustrate our approach in two different robotics scenarios.},

 abstract = {Behavior Trees (BTs) have become a popular framework for designing controllers of autonomous agents in the computer game and in the robotics industry. One of the key advantages of BTs lies in their modularity, where independent modules can be composed to create more complex ones. In the classical formulation of BTs, modules can be composed using one of the three operators: Sequence, Fallback, and Parallel. The Parallel operator is rarely used despite its strong potential against other control architectures as Finite State Machines. This is due to the fact that concurrent actions may lead to unexpected problems similar to the ones experienced in concurrent programming. In this paper, we introduce Concurrent BTs (CBTs) as a generalization of BTs in which we introduce the notions of progress and resource usage. We show how CBTs allow safe concurrent executions of actions and we analyze the approach from a mathematical standpoint. To illustrate the use of CBTs, we provide a set of use cases in robotics scenarios.},

 abstract = {A Behavior Tree (BT) is a way to structure the switching between different tasks in an autonomous agent, such as a robot or a virtual entity in a computer game. BTs are a very efficient way of creating complex systems that are both modular and reactive. These properties are crucial in many applications, which has led to the spread of BT from computer game programming to many branches of AI and Robotics. In this book, we will first give an introduction to BTs, then we describe how BTs relate to, and in many cases generalize, earlier switching structures. These ideas are then used as a foundation for a set of efficient and easy to use design principles. Properties such as safety, robustness, and efficiency are important for an autonomous system, and we describe a set of tools for formally analyzing these using a state space description of BTs. With the new analysis tools, we can formalize the descriptions of how BTs generalize earlier approaches. We also show the use of BTs in automated planning and machine learning. Finally, we describe an extended set of tools to capture the behavior of Stochastic BTs, where the outcomes of actions are described by probabilities. These tools enable the computation of both success probabilities and time to completion.},

The location of the docking station has a considerable effect on task performance. In nonstationary tasks the optimal dock location may vary over the length of the task. In multiple-robot systems, spatial interference between charging and working robots can make it difficult to find an optimal dock location, even in static tasks. We propose a new approach whereby the dock is itself an autonomous robot that attempts to incrementally improve its location. We show simulation results from a simple local controller that adapts to nonstationary tasks and spatial interference, and thus improves overall task performance compared to a static dock.},

 abstract = {Monte Carlo methods are revolutionising the on-line analysis of data in fields as diverse as financial modelling, target tracking and computer vision. These methods, appearing under the names of bootstrap filters, condensation, optimal Monte Carlo filters, particle filters and survial of the fittest, have made it possible to solve numerically many complex, non-standarard problems that were previously intractable. This book presents the first comprehensive treatment of these techniques, including convergence results and applications to tracking, guidance, automated target recognition, aircraft navigation, robot navigation, econometrics, financial modelling, neural networks,optimal control, optimal filtering, communications, reinforcement learning, signal enhancement, model averaging and selection, computer vision, semiconductor design, population biology, dynamic Bayesian networks, and time series analysis. This will be of great value to students, researchers and practicioners, who have some basic knowledge of probability. Arnaud Doucet received the Ph. D. degree from the University of Paris- XI Orsay in 1997. From 1998 to 2000, he conducted research at the Signal Processing Group of Cambridge University, UK. He is currently an assistant professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering of Melbourne University, Australia. His research interests include Bayesian statistics, dynamic models and Monte Carlo methods. Nando de Freitas obtained a Ph.D. degree in information engineering from Cambridge University in 1999. He is presently a research associate with the artificial intelligence group of the University of California at Berkeley. His main research interests are in Bayesian statistics and the application of on-line and batch Monte Carlo methods to machine learning},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a vision-based autonomous docking and recharging system that can operate in warehouse environment. The AprilTag is employed to provide the relative position of docking and charging devices. In addition, the docking mechanism applies two docking processes: searching zone process and approaching zone process. The experiment in the warehouse environment shows the docking success rate is around 97.33{\%} with high accuracy. Different start position and approaching points may also influence the docking duration. The angel between the start point and charging station is negatively related to average duration time and the distance between approaching point and charging station is also negatively related to average duration.},

 abstract = {Fiducial marker systems have unique designs and various geometric shapes but all of them could be automatically detected with cameras. Fiducial marker system are used in such fields as augmented reality applications, medicine, space and robot-assisted tasks. A variety of applications determines criteria, which characterize qualitative properties of a marker and include such evaluation benchmarks as resilience to occlusion, distance to a marker, false positive and false negative rates, sensitivity to illumination, and others. This paper presents experimental comparison of existing ARTag, AprilTag, and CALTag systems with regard to their reliability and detection rate in occlusions of various types and intensities. Two camera types are used for experiments: inexpensive Web camera FaceCam 1000X and a high fidelity camera, which is a main vision sensor of a Russian humanoid robot AR-601M. In addition, we describe preliminary results of virtual experiments in ROS Gazebo environment. Our long term goal is to calibrate humanoid robot manipulators in real-world environment applying a pre-calibrated camera of the robot, while the presented in this paper results help selecting a most suitable marker system for further calibration procedures.},

The proper selection of these positions is of paramount importance to operate with the industrial grade of accuracy, repeatability, and reliability required by load transfer operations in industrial settings. An unconstrained optimization method coupled with probabilistic techniques is proposed to solve this problem. The proposed method permits to increase significantly the flexibility and adaptability of the autonomous robotic forklifts.},

@article{Hu.2015,
 abstract = {Medical robots have been widely used to assist surgeons to carry out dexterous surgical tasks via various ways. Most of the tasks require surgeon's operation directly or indirectly. Certain level of autonomy in robotic surgery could not only free the surgeon from some tedious repetitive tasks, but also utilize the advantages of robot: high dexterity and accuracy. This paper presents a semi-autonomous neurosurgical procedure of brain tumor ablation using RAVEN Surgical Robot and stereo visual feedback. By integrating with the behavior tree framework, the whole surgical task is modeled flexibly and intelligently as nodes and leaves of a behavior tree. This paper provides three contributions mainly: (1) describing the brain tumor ablation as an ideal candidate for autonomous robotic surgery, (2) modeling and implementing the semi-autonomous surgical task using behavior tree framework, and (3) designing an experimental simulated ablation task for feasibility study and robot performance analysis.},

 abstract = {A heuristic path following algorithm for wheeled mobile robots is presented. This approach is based on the orthogonal projection to the path and exponential functions for lateral and longitudinal control. It allows smooth and stable navigation in dynamic and cluttered environments, and does not depend on the robot's kinematics. The results are experimentally demonstrated using three different kinematic configurations: omnidirectional, Ackermann- and two-steering.},

 abstract = {We present GeRoNa (Generic Robot Navigation), a modular navigation framework for wheeled mobile robots. This framework supports many different kinematic configurations of wheeled robots and was experimentally verified on eight different real-world robotic platforms, including Ackermann steering, bi-steerable, skid-steered, differentially-driven and omnidirectional vehicles. The real-world experiments include indoor and outdoor tests, on various terrain types, driving up to 6 m/s. The framework provides A*-based path planning algorithms, high speed obstacle avoidance (tested at speeds up to 2.5 m/s) and twelve different control algorithms for path following. In this paper, we present the whole framework, detail every controller and provide an extensive experimental evaluation of the most important components. The entire framework is already open-source available, written in C++ and based on ROS (Robot Operating System).},

 abstract = {The efficiency of autonomous robots depends on how well they understand their operating environment. While most of the traditional environment models focus on the spatial representation, long-term mobile robot operation in human populated environments requires that the robots have a basic model of human behaviour. We present a framework that allows us to retrieve and represent aggregate human behaviour in large, populated environments on extended temporal scales. Our approach, based on time-varying Poisson process models and spectral analysis, efficiently retrieves long-term, re-occurring patterns of human activity from robot-gathered observations and uses these patterns to i) predict human activity level at particular times and places and ii) classify locations based on their periodic patterns of activity. The application of our framework on real-world data, gathered by a mobile robot operating in an indoor environment for one month, indicates that its predictive capabilities outperform other temporal modelling methods while being computationally more efficient. The experiment also demonstrates that spectral signatures act as features that allow us to classify room types which semantically match with humans' expectations.},

 abstract = {Detecting features in sensor measurements and distinguishing among them is an important capability for robot localization and navigation. Despite the wide diffusion of range finders, there are few works on keypoint features for 2-D LIDAR and there is potential for improvement over the existing methods. This letter proposes two novel keypoint detectors for the stable detection of interest points in laser measurements and two descriptors for robust associations. The features defined by combining keypoints and descriptors allow stable and efficient place recognition. Experiments with standard benchmark datasets assess the performance of the detectors and descriptors investigated. One of the proposed features, termed FALKO-BSC, achieves higher repeatability score and similar descriptor performance compared with the FLIRT state-of-the-art feature. FALKO-BSC is also shown to enable effective localization.},

A recharging station is designed consisting of a stationary docking station and a docking mechanism mounted to an ER-1 Evolution Robotics robot. The docking station and docking mechanism serve as a dual-power source, providing a mechanical and electrical connection between the recharging system of the robot and a laptop placed on it. Docking strategy algorithms use vision based navigation. The result is a significantly low-cost, high-entrance angle tolerant system. Iterative improvements to the system, to resist environmental perturbations and implement obstacle avoidance, ultimately resulted in a docking success rate of 100 percent over 50 trials.},

 abstract = {Automated target acquisition and docking is key to enabling various applications of autonomous mobile robots in indoor environments. For the purpose, many researches have been devoted to the development of location sensing techniques employing the latest in RFID or GPS. However, it has not yet become possible to attain high accuracy in those techniques, particularly in cluttered or dynamically changing environments. In this paper, we propose a novel location sensing RFID reader equipped with a dual directional antenna that communicates with controllable RF transponders. The dual directional antenna estimates the direction of arrival (DOA) of signals from various transponders by using the ratio of the received strength between two antennas. This enables the robot to continuously monitor the changes in the ratio and find its way to the target transponder. To verify the validity of the proposed system in real environments populated with unknown obstacles, we perform detailed experiments using simulations and hardware implementations. Specifically, the target acquisition and docking guidance are demonstrated in a multiple transponder environment under various circumstances.},

 abstract = {We propose a new idea for life-long mobile robot spatio-temporal exploration of dynamic environments. Our method assumes that the world is subject to perpetual change, which adds an extra, temporal dimension to the explored space and makes the exploration task a never-ending data-gathering process. To create and maintain a spatio-temporal model of a dynamic environment, the robot has to determine not only where, but also when to perform observations. We address the problem by application of information-theoretic exploration to world representations that model the uncertainty of environment states as probabilistic functions of time. We compare the performance of different exploration strategies and temporal models on real-world data gathered over the course of several months and show that combination of dynamic environment representations with information-gain exploration principles allows to create and maintain up-to-date models of constantly changing environments.},

It consists in following a planned trajectory and reaching a docking configuration, defined relatively to the environment. The trajectory is deformed in order to reach the docking configuration, to avoid obstacles and to keep the nonholonomic constraints satisfied. A generic framework to compute the docking configuration is presented. Then we give the principle of a nonholonomic path deformation method that was used to deform the planned trajectory towards the docking configuration. This framework has been tested on a real robot with a trailer in a realistic scenario},

 abstract = {Intelligent wheelchair is a paradigm of assisted living applications for elderly and disabled people. Its autonomous navigation and human-robot interaction is the major challenge. The previous intelligent wheelchair research has been mainly focused on geometric map based navigation, which is computational expensive in a large scale environment. This paper proposes the use of multi-layered maps for navigation and interaction of an intelligent wheelchair. The semantic information can improve the efficiency of path planning and navigation as well as extend the capability of task planning for the wheelchair. Some experimental results are given to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed approach. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

@article{Lowe.2004,
 abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

 abstract = {To keep autonomous mobile robot in continuously working condition, power supply is an important issue. Typically, rechargeable batteries may provide few hours of peak usage. Recharging is necessary before the power of the batteries has exhausted. In this paper, the docking station with an auto-recharging device and robot docking mechanism are implemented. We propose a docking control strategy and automatic recharging device for the security robot recharging. We also propose a power prediction algorithm to determine when the robot needs to navigate back to docking station for recharging. An artificial landmark is detected and recognized by the proposed image processing system. Then the geometrical relationship between the robot and the docking station (the depth and orientation) is estimated. The robot will move directly right in front of the docking station. Finally, the robot approaches to the docking station based on the proposed virtual spring model. In this model, we assume that the robot and the docking station are connected by a virtual spring. The compliant forces act both in the direction of the translation deformation and bending. The motion control parameters, which are velocities of the two wheels, can be derived from the model. Experimental results show that the proposed methods successfully perform the docking and automatic recharging.},

An artificial landmark is employed as a visual cue on a docking station in order to recognize the location by using inverse perspective projection. At the same time, the range data acquired by laser range finder are modeled as multiple line segments which are the hypothetical walls in the environment.

@article{McCarthy.2008,
 abstract = {We present a robust strategy for docking a mobile robot in close proximity with an upright surface using optical flow field divergence and proportional feedback control. Unlike previous approaches, we achieve this without the need for explicit segmentation of features in the image, and using complete gradient-based optical flow estimation (i.e., no affine models) in the optical flow computation. A key contribution is the development of an algorithm to compute the flow field divergence, or time-to-contact, in a manner that is robust to small rotations of the robot during ego-motion. This is done by tracking the {\textless}i{\textgreater}focus{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}of{\textless}/i{\textgreater} {\textless}i{\textgreater}expansion{\textless}/i{\textgreater} of the flow field and using this to compensate for ego rotation of the image. The control law used is a simple proportional feedback, using the unfiltered flow field divergence as an input, for a dynamic vehicle model. Closed-loop stability analysis of docking under the proposed feedback is provided. Performance of the flow field divergence algorithm is demonstrated using offboard natural image sequences, and the performance of the closed-loop system is experimentally demonstrated by control of a mobile robot approaching a wall.},

Autonomous docking is essential for large scale robotic teams to be delivered by larger robots, recovered, recharged, and redeployed for continuous operation. Using a computer vision based approach, we identify cues to line up for docking by extracting corner pixels and combining this information with color information. Potential target points are extracted and clustered using Euclidean distance in the image plane. Using these clusters of points the appropriate motion behavior is selected to reposition the robot into the desired position and orientation. This paper will present examples of this implementation using an eROSI robot which uses only vision to navigate.},

To provide an overview and tutorial of natural language processing (NLP) and modern NLP-system design.

TARGET AUDIENCE

This tutorial targets the medical informatics generalist who has limited acquaintance with the principles behind NLP and/or limited knowledge of the current state of the art.

SCOPE

We describe the historical evolution of NLP, and summarize common NLP sub-problems in this extensive field. We then provide a synopsis of selected highlights of medical NLP efforts. After providing a brief description of common machine-learning approaches that are being used for diverse NLP sub-problems, we discuss how modern NLP architectures are designed, with a summary of the Apache Foundation's Unstructured Information Management Architecture. We finally consider possible future directions for NLP, and reflect on the possible impact of IBM Watson on the medical field.},

@article{NicholasCarlevarisBianco.2015,
 abstract = {Abstract : One of the core competencies required for autonomous mobile robotics is the ability to use sensors to perceive the environment. From this noisy sensor data, the robot must build a representation of the environment and localize itself within this representation. This process, known as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a prerequisite for almost all higher-level autonomous behavior in mobile robotics. By associating the robot{\&}{\#}39;s sensory observations as it moves through the environment, and by observing the robot{\&}{\#}39;s ego-motion through proprioceptive sensors constraints are placed on the trajectory of the robot and the configuration of the environment. This results in a probabilistic optimization problem to find the most likely robot trajectory and environment configuration given all of the robot{\&}{\#}39;s previous sensory experience. SLAM has been well studied under the assumptions that the robot operates for a relatively short time period and that the environment is essentially static during operation. However, performing SLAM over long time periods while modeling the dynamic changes in the environment remains a challenge. The goal of this thesis is to extend the capabilities of SLAM to enable long-term autonomous operation in dynamic environments. The contribution of this thesis has three main components First, we propose a framework for controlling the computational complexity of the SLAM optimization problem so that it does not grow unbounded with exploration time. Second, we present a method to learn visual feature descriptors that are more robust to changes in lighting, allowing for improved data association in dynamic environments. Finally, we use the proposed sparseapproximate marginalization and learned visual features in a SLAM system that explicitly models the dynamics of the environment in the map by representing each location as a set of example views that capture how the location changes with time.},

@article{Oh.2000,
 abstract = {This paper describes a method for automatically recharging the batteries on a mobile robot. The robot used in this project is the Nomadic Technologies? Nomad XR4000 mobile robot. The battery recharging system was implemented using the robot's built-in sensors to control docking with a simple recharging station. The recharging station has an AC power plug, an infra-red beacon and a target designed for detection by the Sick Laser Range Finder. The robot's IR sensors perform the beacon detection. The robot moves towards the beacon until the laser target pattern is visible to the Sick laser. The system is currently under development and undergoing its performance testing. 1 Introduction A mobile robot is being prepared at the Australian National University for teleoperation using a Webbrowser from the Internet. It is intended that the robot will be available to operators continuously with only occasional local intervention required. With a battery life of approximately 6 ...},

@article{OmidMajdani.2010,
 abstract = {We have demonstrated that an automated insertion tool (i.e. a robot)

can be used to duplicate a complex surgical motion in inserting cochlear

implant (CI) electrode arrays via the 'advance-off-stylet' (AOS)

technique. As compared with human operators, the forces generated

by the robot were slightly larger but the robot was more reliable

(i.e. less force maxima).We present force data collected during CI

electrode insertion by human operators and by an automated insertion

tool.Using a three-dimensional, anatomically correct, translucent

model of the scala tympani chamber of the cochlea, CI electrodes

were inserted either by one of three surgeons (26 insertions) or

by the robotic insertion tool (8 insertions). Force was recorded

using a load beam cell calibrated for expected forces of {\textless}0.1 Newtons

(N). The insertions were also videotaped to allow correlation of

force with depth of penetration into the cochlea and speed of insertion.Average

insertion force used by the surgeons was 0.004+/-0.001 N and for

the insertion tool it was 0.005+/-0.014 N (p{\textless}0.00001, Student's t

test). While the average insertion force of the automated tool was

larger than that of the surgeons, the surgeons did have intermittent

peaks during the AOS component of the insertion (between 120 degrees

and 200 degrees ).},

@article{Perera.4162017,
 abstract = {In this paper we present our work with the Pepper robot, a service robot from SoftBank Robotics. We had two main goals in this work: improving the autonomy of this robot by increasing its awareness of the environment; and enhance the robot ability to interact with its users. To achieve this goals, we used ROS, a modern open-source framework for developing robotics software, to provide Pepper with state of the art localization and navigation capabilities. Furthermore, we contribute an architecture for effective human interaction based on cloud services. Our architecture improves Pepper speech recognition capabilities by connecting it to the IBM Bluemix Speech Recognition service and enable the robot to recognize its user via an in-house face recognition web-service. We show examples of our successful integration of ROS and IBM services with Pepper's own software. As a result, we were able to make Pepper move autonomously in a environment with humans and obstacles. We were also able to have Pepper execute spoken commands from known users as well as newly introduced users that were enrolled in the robot list of trusted users via a multi-modal interface.},

 abstract = {An auto-recharging system for a mobile robot can help the robot to perform its tasks constantly and without human intervention. For implementing the system, a docking mechanism is required. This paper presents a new docking mechanism with a localization error-compensation capability. The proposed mechanism uses the combination of mechanical structure and magnetic forces between the docking connectors. It is a structure to improve the allowance ranges of lateral and directional docking errors, in which the robot is able to dock into the docking station. Consequently, this mechanism reduces dependency of a robot control and allows easy docking with only mechanical configuration. In this paper, the superiority of the proposed mechanism is verified with experimental results.},

@incollection{Rosenthal.2012c,
 abstract = {Indoor autonomous mobile service robots can overcome their hardware and potential algorithmic limitations by asking humans for help. In this work, we focus on mobile robots that need human assistance at specific spatially-situated locations (e.g., to push buttons in an elevator or to make coffee in the kitchen). We address the problem of what the robot should do when there are no humans present at such help locations. As the robots are mobile, we argue that they should plan to proactively seek help and travel to offices or occupied locations to bring people to the help locations. Such planning involves many trade-offs, including the wait time at the help location before seeking help, and the time and potential interruption to find and displace someone in an office. In order to choose appropriate parameters to represent such decisions, we first conduct a survey to understand potential helpers' travel preferences in terms of distance, interruptibility, and frequency of providing help. We then use these results to contribute a decision-theoretic algorithm to evaluate the possible choices in offices and plan where to proactively seek help. We demonstrate that our algorithm aims to minimize the number of office interruptions as well as task completion time.

@article{RosenthalvonderPutten.2019,
 abstract = {Artificial agents are becoming prevalent across human life domains. However, the neural mechanisms underlying human responses to these new, artificial social partners remain unclear. The uncanny valley (UV) hypothesis predicts that humans prefer anthropomorphic agents but reject them if they become too humanlike-the so-called UV reaction. Using fMRI, we investigated neural activity when subjects evaluated artificial agents and made decisions about them. Across two experimental tasks, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) encoded an explicit representation of subjects' UV reactions. Specifically, VMPFC signaled the subjective likability of artificial agents as a nonlinear function of humanlikeness, with selective low likability for highly humanlike agents. In exploratory across-subject analyses, these effects explained individual differences in psychophysical evaluations and preference choices. Functionally connected areas encoded critical inputs for these signals: the temporoparietal junction encoded a linear humanlikeness continuum, whereas nonlinear representations of humanlikeness in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and fusiform gyrus emphasized a human-nonhuman distinction. Following principles of multisensory integration, multiplicative combination of these signals reconstructed VMPFC's valuation function. During decision making, separate signals in VMPFC and DMPFC encoded subjects' decision variable for choices involving humans or artificial agents, respectively. A distinct amygdala signal predicted rejection of artificial agents. Our data suggest that human reactions toward artificial agents are governed by a neural mechanism that generates a selective, nonlinear valuation in response to a specific feature combination (humanlikeness in nonhuman agents). Thus, a basic principle known from sensory coding-neural feature selectivity from linear-nonlinear transformation-may also underlie human responses to artificial social partners.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Would you trust a robot to make decisions for you? Autonomous artificial agents are increasingly entering our lives, but how the human brain responds to these new artificial social partners remains unclear. The uncanny valley (UV) hypothesis-an influential psychological framework-captures the observation that human responses to artificial agents are nonlinear: we like increasingly anthropomorphic artificial agents, but feel uncomfortable if they become too humanlike. Here we investigated neural activity when humans evaluated artificial agents and made personal decisions about them. Our findings suggest a novel neurobiological conceptualization of human responses toward artificial agents: the UV reaction-a selective dislike of highly humanlike agents-is based on nonlinear value-coding in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a key component of the brain's reward system.},

@proceedings{Roth.1998,
 abstract = {The actual developed generation of automated guided vehicles (AGVs), used for the flow of materials in industrial production lines, offer increased flexibility by storing the reference path in the vehicle's on-board computer. This requires an effective path planning strategy, in particular with respect to navigation, collision avoidance and docking to target stations. Sensors to support these manoeuvres need to be robust, to survive in the rough industrial environment, cheap, to be an alternative to the existing wire-guided vehicles, and accurate, to meet the performance requirements. To cope with all these topics different low-cost sensors have to be used and their information has to be fused by intelligent algorithms. This paper addresses the combination of measurement signals of simple CCD-cameras, odometry sensors and ultrasonic sensors for a low cost approach to free navigation including target docking. The performance of this concept has been proofed by factory trial tests in the frame of the ESPRIT-project RETRARO in the production environment of the company Schoeller-Bregenz, active in the area of wool processing and spinning.},

@proceedings{Silverman.2002,
 abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots are constrained in their long-term functionality due to a limited on-board power supply. Typically, rechargeable batteries are utilized that may only provide a few hours of peak usage before recharging is necessary. Recharging requires a robot to be taken offline, and attached to a battery charger via human intervention. This is unacceptable in environments where long-term autonomous capabilities are necessary. We present a method to provide long-term autonomy by implementing autonomous recharging. A recharging station design is presented, consisting of a stationary docking station and a docking mechanism mounted to a Pioneer 2DX robot. The docking station and robot docking mechanism are designed to work together, providing a mechanical and electrical connection between the charging system and the robot. Algorithms are implemented to monitor the battery voltage and control the docking procedure, as well as account for any errors that may occur. Initial experiments that demonstrate the validity of the approach and design are presented.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the development and characterization of a surveillance robot with automatic docking and recharging capabilities for home security. The proposed system is composed of a surveillance robot and a docking station. The palm-sized surveillance robot has a triangular shape with three wheels. It communicates with the general wireless home router through WiFi. It communicates with the docking station through ZigBee and serves as a mobile wireless sensor network gateway. The docking station has a trapezoidal structure with an arc-shaped docking interface. A docking method based on the self-localization of the robot and the infrared detectors of the docking station is proposed. The robot can return to the docking station for recharging operations when the on-board battery is too low. The experimental results show that the prototype robot achieved a success rate of 90{\%} after 60 different docking attempts.},

@proceedings{Su.2014,
 abstract = {The article develops a multi-docking system with a mobile robot and three docking stations. The docking structure is designed with one active degree of freedom and two passive degrees of freedom. The controller of the power detection devices is HOLTEK microchip, and acquires measurement values of the real-time current and voltage of the mobile robot and the docking stations. The power detection devices contain three power detection systems and one power detection module. The power detection system is embedded in the docking station and monitors the real-time information for the charging process. The controller of the mobile robot receives these measurement values from the power detection module via RS232 interface. The article focuses on the searching process using multiple sensors and a laser range finder for the mobile robot. The laser range finder searches the landmark of each docking station, and guides the mobile robot moving to the assigned docking station. In the experimental results, the power of the mobile robot is under the threshold value. The mobile robot selects the free and nearest docking station according to the received information from each docking station via wireless RF interfaces. The laser range finder guides the mobile robot moving approach to the assigned docking station. The power of the mobile robot is enough to be detected by the power detection module. The docking station turns off the charging current, and trigs the mobile robot leaving the docking station via wireless RF interface.},

In this paper, we have focused on a domestic application, more specifically the development of a custom designed low cost mobile robot - RoboMuse 4.0, into a highly capable mobile assistant. From following a person around carrying his or her load, to acting as a mobile guide which is capable of autonomously charging itself by docking into a charging station, we have concentrated on automating the mobile functions of an assistant. This was achieved through various subtasks including simultaneous localization and mapping, autonomous exploration, point to point navigation, and autonomous docking and charging. The performance of the robot was also evaluated through various established and customized tests, the results of which have also been included in this paper.},

 abstract = {The paper deals with the evaluation of visual markers detection. The markers are used for the navigation during the autonomous mobile robot docking procedure. In order to navigate to the docking station, the station must be easily detectable. AR (augmented reality) markers are designed with respect to the precision and low computational load of detection. The paper evaluates the properties of detection for AR markers supported in ROS, in particular the Alvar and Apriltag markers detectors. Experiments handle both single and double markers, precision is evaluated with respect to the distance, angle and relative tangential velocity of robot's camera towards the marker.},

The objective is to perform indoor navigation efficiently and at the same time make the cost of the device as low as possible so as to make it commercializable. Here, we proposed an approach based on recognition of two infrared generated ceiling spots, which remains invisible to human eyes but easily captured by infrared camera. Then we use this image to locate the position of a robot and finally control the robot to the destination in the room, for example to its charging station. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in real environment and opens new doors for future research.},

 abstract = {This work addresses the path tracking problem of industrial guidance systems used by automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in load transfer operations. We focus on the control law that permits to AGVs to operate tracking a predefined route with industrial grade of accuracy, repeatability and reliability. One of the main issues of this problem is related to the important weight variation of AGVs when transporting a load, which induces slipping and skidding effects. Besides, localization error of the guidance system should be taken into account because position estimation is typically performed at a low sample rate. Other key point is that control law oscillations can knock down the load, which gives rise to safety and performance problems. Three control techniques - fuzzy, vector pursuit and flatness-based control - are compared in order to evaluate how they can deal with these problems and satisfy the robustness requirements of such an industrial application.},

A novel docking algorithm was developed to determine the initial distance and orientation of the two modules, and sensor models were established through experiments. Both Extended Kalman filter (EKF) and particle filter (PF) were deployed to fuse the measurements from IR and encoders and provide accurate estimates of orientation and distance. Simulation experiments were carried out first and then real experiments were conducted to verify the feasibility and good performance of the proposed docking algorithm and system. The proposed system provides a robust and reliable docking solution using low cost sensors.},

 abstract = {Human detection and tracking is an essential task for service robots, where the combined use of multiple sensors has potential advantages that are yet to be exploited. In this paper, we introduce a framework allowing a robot to learn a new 3D LiDAR-based human classifier from other sensors over time, taking advantage of a multisensor tracking system. The main innovation is the use of different detectors for existing sensors (i.e. RGB-D camera, 2D LiDAR) to train, online, a new 3D LiDAR-based human classifier, exploiting a so-called trajectory probability. Our framework uses this probability to check whether new detections belongs to a human trajectory, estimated by different sensors and/or detectors, and to learn a human classifier in a semi-supervised fashion. The framework has been implemented and tested on a real-world dataset collected by a mobile robot. We present experiments illustrating that our system is able to effectively learn from different sensors and from the environment, and that the performance of the 3D LiDAR-based human classification improves with the number of sensors/detectors used.},

The corners, the intersection point of two line segments and the two endpoints of each line segment extracted from raw sensor data, can be chosen as landmarks to estimate the position of mobile robot or used to do mapping unknown environment without artificial landmarks intentionally. Sufficient landmarks are the precondition for realizing robot localization and Mapping Environment very well. In addition, the covariance matrix of corners, propagated from covariance matrices of line segments, is derived using the first-order Taylor expansion and it is proved by comparing the uncertainty ellipse drawing from the ellipse of line segments and that from covariance matrix of corners in real experiments. Experiment results of line extraction and corner extraction in the complex environment with the HOKUYO laser sensor located on the Pioneer mobile robot are presented to proving the validity of this algorithm.},

 abstract = {An automated warehouse system contains a number of materials, workstations, and multiple Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). The automated warehouse is server-controlled. This paper proposes a collision-free routing method for AGVs based on collision classification. This method can deal with collisions arising in the automated warehouse. It first divides the warehouse environment into five areas, and then performs route planning. In this paper, the environment map for AGVs is described by using the grid method. The initial route of each task is predetermined by improved Dijkstra's algorithm. The server detects the potential collisions by comparing each workstation's ID and corresponding time window in every route. This paper presents four collision classifications and three solutions. Based upon the analyses and experiments, we select the corresponding solution for each type of collision. Presented case studies demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed collision-free route planning approach.},
